This information is based on ATOM Firmware v3.00 as reported by Universal Control

Messages are sent to ATOM on MIDI channels 1, 2-4 (RGB Color Settings), and 16 (Native Control)

One of the first things I discovered was how Studio One gets the ATOM in and out of Native Control Mode. 

Studio One Native Control:
Enable (Blue Logo): Channel 16 Note Off 0 Velocity 127
Disable (Green Logo): Channel 16 Note Off 0 Velocity 0

Everything below is based on being in Native Control Mode. 

Pad LEDs:

Pad Note xx is 36 - 51 for Pads 01-16. Note that there are no "Banks" in NC mode. 

Pad xx LED On: Channel 1 Note On xx Velocity 127
Pad xx LED Off: Channel 1 Note On xx Velocity 0

Pad LED Color:

This even works if the Pad LED isn't On, so you can pre-set the color and then turn the pad LED on. 

Channel 2: Red
Channel 3: Green
Channel 4: Blue

Channel X Note On xx Velocity yy
where X is for RGB channels (2-4), xx is pad note (36-51), yy is intensity (0-127)


Button LEDs:

Button CCs are defined in Section 5 of the ATOM Owner's Manual. Note that there is no "shifted" CCs in NC mode. The <SHIFT> button is CC 32 which isn't defined in Section 5. 

On and Off is actually Bright and Dim. There's no way that I've found (yet) to actually turn off the button LEDs.

Button xx LED On: Channel 1 CC xx 127
Button xx LED Off: Channel 1 CC xx 0

Button LED Color:

There are three buttons that allow their colors to be changed in the same as the pads.

Preset +/- (27), Bank (26), and Play (109)

Instead of using Note On we need to use:

Channel 2 CC xx yy -- Red
Channel 3 CC xx yy -- Green
Channel 4 CC xx yy -- Blue


Encoders:

Encoder 1 - 4 are Channel 1 CC 14 - 17 <direction>

Rotate Clockwise is CC xx 1 for each step 
Rotate Counter-Clockwise is CC xx 65 for each step 

Encoders are continuous in this mode. One full rotation is XX steps. (Need to figure this out. Looks like about 32)
